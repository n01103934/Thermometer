This week I soldered my TMP006 IR temperature sensor, connected wires from my sensor to broadcom development platform and have completed getting my sensor to detect my I2C address on Raspberry Pi 3. I researched my sensor's pin layout to determine how to change my default I2C address from (0x40) to (0x46) for my temperature sensor. Based on the project schedule I am on track because it shows that week eight I have to complete the breadboard milestone. Next week I have to design a PCB Board, I already emailed the prototype lab my gerber files of my circuit diagram in order to design one. The project has not changed I am still using the same materials like my TMP006 Sensor and Raspberry Pi 3 based from my Proposal.
