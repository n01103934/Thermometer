This week I soldered my PCB for my TMP006 IR Temperature Sensor and Raspberry Pi 3 with the help of the prototype lab. I am currently testing out if my Raspberry Pi 3 can detect my sensor on PCB inorder to detect data from it and display it to the screen. My project has not changed I am still using both my Temperature Sensor and Raspberry Pi. I still need to figure out how to get my I2C address and data from sensor by next week but other than that the project is going well. My financial status is good I am using the same materials in my budget but it could change if my materials are damaged. There are links below this weeks dicussion to my soldered PCB below to show what I did for this week.

This week I will have designed a PCB for my TMP006 IR Temperature Sensor and Raspberry Pi 3. I should get it soon from the prototype lab to be able soldering it for next week. Based on my project schedule I am still on track as long as I get my PCB designed and soldered by next week. My project has not changed based from my proposal I am still using the same materials from before to build it. My financial update is good I am still under budget and most of the stuff I need I already have so their is no need to buy more materials for my project. I have included the fritzing file for my project in my respository to look at how I designed the pcb. Here are links at the bottom of this weeks discussion on my design files for breadboard, schematic, and pcb diagrams.

This week I soldered my TMP006 IR Temperature sensor, connected wires from my sensor to broadcom development platform and have completed getting my sensor to detect my I2C address on Raspberry Pi 3. I researched my sensor's pin layout to determine how to change my default I2C address from (0x40) to (0x46) for my temperature sensor. I found out to get my I2C address you have to connect wires from Add0 to SDA and Add1 to VCC from my sensor connected to breadboard. I have provided links at the bottom of this weeks discussion for observing my breadboard circuit and I2C address from my sensor below.  Based on the project schedule I am on track because it shows that week eight I have to complete the breadboard milestone. Next week I have to design a PCB Board, I already emailed the prototype lab my gerber files of my circuit diagram in order to design one. The project has not changed I am still using the same materials like my TMP006 IR Temperature Sensor and Raspberry Pi 3 based from my Proposal.

This week I will solder my header pins for my temperature sensor on the breadboard and connect them with my developmental platform.

# Oct 9 2018
I have my parts with me and working on fritzing my connections on breadboard.
