This File
---------

This is a demonstration of a MarkDown (.md) README file.

Start editing this file by first installing Pandoc:
https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.16.0.2/pandoc-1.16.0.2-windows.msi

Second, install Texts: http://www.texts.io/Texts-1.3.2.msi

Now you can open README.md using Texts and modify it. You can also export a .pdf
from the .md.

Ctrl-K can be used to modify Table of Contents entries/links, note that if a
Table of Contents is not created in the .md file it can be generated during the
export to .pdf process.

Ctrl-Shift-R can be used for adding citations. A citation example is for the
publication that we have referred to in our proposals where visiting the DOI
link below provides a page where a citation can be downloaded in the BibTex
format. This .bib bibliography file can then be added to this file. Next the
style .csl can be downloaded from https://www.zotero.org/styles/apa [@6894583]
\<- this will become (Segura-Garcia, Felici-Castell, Perez-Solano, Cobos, &
Navarro, 2015) plus the following entry will be added to the References when
this file is exported to .pdf which also triggers the installation of XeLaTeX:

Segura-Garcia, J., Felici-Castell, S., Perez-Solano, J. J., Cobos, M., &
Navarro, J. M. (2015). Low-cost alternatives for urban noise nuisance monitoring
using wireless sensor networks. *IEEE Sensors Journal*, *15*(2), 836â€“844.
<https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2356342>

Regarding an example for the Fall 2017 session I use the below to generate the
content which appears in the References List when the pdf is exported.
