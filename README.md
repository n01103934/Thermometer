# Introduction
My project I am working with deals with reading temperature data from a temperature sensor. My sensor 
is called a TMP006 IR Temperature Sensor that can measure the temperature of any object without making direct contact with it.
It detects and absorbs the infrared energy from an object regardless of how hot or cold it is. I plan on storing 
my temperature data from my sensor to the Firebase database where all my data is stored. The reason why I chose this
project is because I was interested in the idea of reading an object's temperature data from the sensor just by pointing my finger
directly close to it.
