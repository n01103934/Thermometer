# Build Instructions

# Introduction
My project I am working with deals with reading temperature data from a temperature sensor. My sensor 
is called a TMP006 IR Temperature Sensor that can measure the temperature of any object without making direct contact with it.
It detects and absorbs the infrared energy from an object regardless of how hot or cold it is. I plan on storing 
my temperature data from my sensor to the Firebase database where all my data is stored. The reason why I chose this
project is because I was interested in the idea of reading an object's temperature data from the sensor just by pointing my finger
directly close to it. Here is a system UML diagram below to show you how my hardware will send data from my Raspberry Pi 3 to my database.

# Bill of Materials/Budget
The total cost of my budget is $131.55 which is below the maximum limit of $150. I did not order any of my hardware materials online instead I went to local electronic stores such as Canada Computers and Creatron Inc. They had everything I needed in my budget including Raspberry Pi 3 kit, TMP006 IR Temperature Sensor, SD Card, USB to Ethernet Adapter, etc. I also included where I got my parts from the links in my budget. Here is a image below to show you my budget and all the materials I used for my project.
